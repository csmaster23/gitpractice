<p>Hello, My name is Tanner Norton. I am a student at Brigham Young University Provo. I am currently a Computer Science Major.<br> I love it so much. Being able to learn about programs, languages, systems, and web design has been a monumental blessing.
<br>The challenge of solving a problem has always interested me, and now I get to have a major where that is what I get to do all the time.
