<p><b>Projects:</b>

<p>Over the course of my learning I have been able to create some great projects that have enhanced my computer science skills.
<ul>
<li>One of the most recent project was being able to create a simulation of cache memory. I wrote it in C, and it was able to simulate how a computer would access different pieces of data with varying block sizes, set numbers, and line numbers.</li>
<li>The second project I will mention was a project in which I was able to design, write, implement, and test a quicksort algorithm. It was an algorithm that took quite a bit of thought. That project really helped me advance as a programmer.</li>
<li>The third project was a great recursive algorithm that solved the problem of how to work through a three dimensional maze. The program could get through any possible maze that had a solution. It was implemented recursively.</li>
</ul>
